  "content": "Hi again,\n\nAs mentioned in the last version, I did a major programming language migration which would certainly result in some bugs.\n\nThanks to my lovely users, several big and small bugs were reported and patched in this version (2.42.5).\n\nMy apologies to those who were affected. If you still encounter any bugs in this version, please report them to me via email or Discord. I'll try to fix them asap.\n\nYou all are awesome and I wish everyone a fantastic day ahead or a good night's sleep.\n\nLove you guys.\nSon Nguyen"
